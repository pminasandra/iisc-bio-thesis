\chapter*{Declaration}
I, Random Undergrad, have under the supervision of Dr\ Interested Faculty between May 2018 and April 2019,
participated in a project to investigate the effect of mitochondria on cell powerhouse-ness. 
No unfair means have been used at any point in this project. All field work has been carried out with
permission from the relevant authorities.
All data, analyses, images, tables, and simulations in this thesis are my own.\\
